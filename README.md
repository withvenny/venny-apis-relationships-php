A user connections management API.

We believe that enabling secure, connections amongst users is a cornerstone of modern digital experiences.

Using Venny I/O APIs and React Native (via Expo) we'll explore a mobile experience framework you can evolve into your own.

## Venny I/O APIs
This API is being leveraged by the Venny I/O Apps for their experiences. Using the apps out of the box communicates directly with the Venny I/O API. You will need an API token in order to make successful calls.
